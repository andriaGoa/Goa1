    <h1>thunder bird</h1>
    <p>The thunderbird is said to create thunder by flapping its wings (Algonquian[2]), and lightning by flashing its eyes (Algonquian, Iroquois[3]). Across cultures, thunderbirds are generally depicted as birds of prey, or hybrids of humans and birds.[1] Thunderbirds are often viewed as protectors, sometimes intervening on people's behalf, but expecting veneration, prayers, and gifts.Archaeologically, sites containing depictions of thunderbirds have been found dating to the past 4,000 years.[1]</p>
