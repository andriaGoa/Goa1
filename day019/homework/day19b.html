    <h1>spinosaurus</h1>
    <p><b>spinosaurus is a genus of spinosaurid dinosaur that lived in what now is north africa during the cenomanian stage of the late cretaceous period, about 100 to 94 million years ago the genus was known first from egyptian remains discovered in 1912 and described by german palaeontologist ernst stromer in 1915 the original remains were destroyed in world war ii, but additional material came to light in the early 21st century it is unclear whether one or two species are represented in the fossils reported in the scientific literature the type species s. aegyptiacus is mainly known from egypt and morocco although a potential second dubious species, s. maroccanus, has been recovered from morocco, this dubious species is likely a junior synonym of s. aegyptiacus other possible junior synonyms include sigilmassasaurus from the kem kem beds in morocco and oxalaia from the alc√¢ntara formation in brazil, though other researchers propose both genera to be distinct taxa</b></p>
